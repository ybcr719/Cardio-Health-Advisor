# Cardio-Health-Advisor
This is a MATLAB code I made for users to help check their cardiovascular health and receive some tips to improve it and what they can do moving forward. To run this program, open the MATLAB code "Cardio Health Advisor" along with "giveExerciseRecommendation" and "giveDietaryRecommendation". Run the "Cardio Health Advisor" file and fill out your information.
